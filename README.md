# 🔬 GastricSentinel

> **Multimodal AI for gastric cancer classification — fusing histopathology, genomics, and clinical data into a single explainable prediction.**

---

## 🧬 What is GastricSentinel?

**GastricSentinel** is a full-stack multimodal AI web application for gastric cancer classification. It fuses three distinct data modalities — histopathological images, genomic profiles, and clinical records — through a dedicated **fusion layer** to produce **8-class probability predictions**. The system also generates explainability outputs via **Grad-CAM** (visual heatmaps over tissue images) and **SHAP values** (feature importance across genomic and clinical inputs), making every prediction interpretable.

Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early and accurate classification is critical, yet manual histopathological screening is slow, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. GastricSentinel aims to assist pathologists and researchers with a fast, multimodal, and explainable second opinion.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js (if using a bundler for frontend)
- pip

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adyashaexe/GastricSentinel.git
cd GastricSentinel
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

The backend API will start at `http://localhost:5000` (or as configured).

### 3. Launch the Frontend

Open `frontend/index.html` directly in your browser, or serve it with any static file server:

```bash
# Using Python's built-in server
cd frontend
python -m http.server 3000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🤖 Model Architecture

GastricSentinel uses a **multimodal deep learning architecture** that processes three input streams in parallel before combining them through a fusion layer for final classification.

```
 Histopathology Images  ──►  CNN Encoder  ──────────────────┐
                                                             │
 Genomic Profiles       ──►  Genomic Encoder  ──────────►  Fusion Layer  ──►  8-Class Output
                                                             │
 Clinical Records       ──►  Clinical Encoder  ────────────┘
```

### Output Classes

The model predicts probabilities across **8 gastric cancer classes**, providing fine-grained classification beyond a simple normal/abnormal split.

### Explainability

| Method | Modality | What it shows |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Grad-CAM** | Image | Heatmap overlay highlighting the tissue regions most influential to the prediction |
| **SHAP** | Genomic & Clinical | Feature importance scores showing which genes and clinical variables drive the model's decision |

Training scripts and notebooks are available in the `/training` directory.
